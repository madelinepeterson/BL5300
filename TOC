#format of raw read data from JGI is interleved-- meaning it contains both the forward and reverse reads in a single file. For my purposes, coding for assembly and annotation is designed to take those read files separately, thus they are separated.

#starting by making a new directory to organize the fastQC output

#output of fastqc shows that the sequences are actually of very nice quality, however we still need to remove the primers and other low quality sequences

#Activating and using de novo assembly tool SPAdes to assemble bin 5
#Note: initial attempt to run SPAdes with kmers sized 21,51,71,91,111,127 created an error by having too many kmers lengths-- too much data to process. Therefor need to more be more efficient with kmer length
